# zen-gc Project Structure

## Overview

`zen-gc` is a production-ready Kubernetes controller for automatic garbage collection of any Kubernetes resource.

## Project Goals

1. **Provide Value**: Solve the real-world problem of resource cleanup in Kubernetes
2. **Production Ready**: Build a reliable, observable, and maintainable solution
3. **Community Driven**: Open source project that welcomes contributions and feedback
4. **Future**: If widely adopted, may be proposed as a Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP)

## Development Status

### Current Status: Production Ready ✅

- ✅ Full-featured GC controller implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive CRD with flexible TTL and condition support
- ✅ Production features (rate limiting, metrics, HA)
- ✅ Extensive test coverage (~65% overall unit tests; `make coverage`)
- ✅ Complete documentation
- ✅ Open source and actively maintained

### Future Considerations

If zen-gc gains significant community adoption and proves valuable to the Kubernetes ecosystem, it may be proposed as a Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) to potentially become part of upstream Kubernetes. However, this is not the primary goal—the focus is on providing a useful, production-ready solution.

## Key Principles

1. **Kubernetes-Native**: Uses standard Kubernetes patterns
2. **Generic**: Works with any Kubernetes resource
3. **Community-Driven**: Open source, community feedback welcome
4. **Production-Ready**: Built-in rate limiting, metrics, and observability

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine KEP document
2. Gather initial community feedback
3. Implement PoC when ready
4. Open source release
5. Submit KEP after validation
