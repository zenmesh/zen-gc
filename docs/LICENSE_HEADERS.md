# License Headers

All source files should include Apache 2.0 license headers.

## Header Format

### Go Files

### YAML Files

```yaml

# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

```

## Adding Headers

You can use a tool like `addlicense`:

```bash
go install github.com/google/addlicense@latest
addlicense -c "Kube-ZEN Contributors" -l apache .
```

## Exceptions

The following files don't need headers:
- Generated files (`zz_generated.deepcopy.go`)
- Configuration files (`.golangci.yml`, `.gitignore`)
- Documentation files (`.md` files)
- Test fixtures

---

**Note**: License headers are recommended but not strictly required for Apache 2.0. The LICENSE file in the root is sufficient for compliance.
