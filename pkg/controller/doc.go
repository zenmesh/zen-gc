// Package controller implements the GarbageCollectionPolicy reconciler, policy
// evaluation, metrics, status updates, and Kubernetes-facing helpers (informers,
// listing, deletion, health).
//
// # Evaluation paths
//
// evaluatePolicy tries, in order:
//
//  1. Primary: PolicyEvaluationService (see evaluate_policy_refactored.go) lists
//     targets via a ResourceLister backed by the policy's resource informer,
//     using injected selector/condition/rate-limit/delete adapters (adapters.go,
//     infrastructure.go). A single service instance is cached on the reconciler
//     after the first successful build (getOrCreateEvaluationService); call sites
//     should assume that cache is process-wide for that reconciler instance.
//
//  2. Fallback: if the service cannot be constructed, the same reconcile uses
//     evaluate_policy_shared.go helpers that read the informer store directly
//     (evaluatePolicyResourcesShared, deleteResourcesInBatchesShared,
//     updatePolicyStatusShared).
//
// Batch sizing for deletes is centralized in batch_config.go (resolveBatchSize).
//
// # Related packages
//
// Webhook admission lives in pkg/webhook. CRD types are pkg/api/v1alpha1.
